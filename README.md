# Activations On The Air

Amateur radio operators love to make contacts with other amateurs, seeking any excuse to get on-air and make noise.

This is an unordered list of programs and sites which facilitate such activities. Note that some activities have cross-over, parks, peaks, summits and flora &amp; fauna for example.

If you'd like to update the list, login to GitHub, click the pencil at the top of this document and suggest an update.

Remember, the purpose of this is to have fun!
